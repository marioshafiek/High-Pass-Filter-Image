### High Pass Filter Image
This is a simple Python program that applies a high pass filter to an image. The program takes an image file as input and applies the filter to create a new image file with the filtered result.

### How it Works
The program first converts the input image to grayscale and then applies a 3x3 high pass filter using the Sobel operator. The filtered image is then saved as a new file.

Usage
To use this program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. Clone the repository and run the high_pass_filter_image.py script with the path to the image file as an argument.
