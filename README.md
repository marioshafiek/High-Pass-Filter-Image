# High Pass Filter Image

A Python program that applies a high pass filter to an image, enhancing edges and fine details.

## Overview

The High Pass Filter Image application is a simple yet powerful tool designed to process images by applying a high pass filter. This technique is commonly used in image processing to enhance edges and fine details in an image. The program takes an image file as input, processes it using a high pass filter, and outputs a new image file with the filtered result.

## How It Works

The program performs the following steps:
1. Converts the input image to grayscale.
2. Applies a 3x3 high pass filter using the Sobel operator.
3. Saves the filtered image as a new file.

## Features

- **Grayscale Conversion**: Converts the input image to grayscale to focus on intensity changes.
- **High Pass Filtering**: Applies a 3x3 high pass filter using the Sobel operator to highlight edges.
- **Output Image**: Saves the processed image as a new file for further use or analysis.
